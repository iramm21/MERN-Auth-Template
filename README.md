# MERN Authentication Template

## Overview
This repository contains a template for a full-stack web application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), focusing on user authentication features. It provides a robust starting point for building applications requiring user sign-up, login, and secure access control.

## Features
- **User Registration**: Allows new users to create an account.
- **User Login**: Enables existing users to log in using their credentials.
- **Session Management**: Manages user sessions to keep users logged in.
- **Secure Password Handling**: Implements password hashing for secure storage.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Uses JWT for secure token-based user authentication.
- **Responsive Design**: Front-end designed to be responsive across devices.
- **Data Validation**: Includes server-side data validation for user inputs.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for a better user experience.

## Technologies Used
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing user data.
- **Express.js**: Backend framework for Node.js.
- **React**: Front-end library for building user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment for the backend.
- **Additional Libraries**: bcrypt for password hashing, JWT for authentication, Mongoose for MongoDB interactions, etc.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js
- MongoDB

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:

   ```
3. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```
   cd client
   npm install
   ```
4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:
   ```
   MONGO_URI=YourMongoDBUri
   JWT_SECRET=YourSecretKey
   ```
5. Run the server:
   ```
